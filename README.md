## Reflection

This was a 4 month project, and is a part of a system made in collaboration with Cordel Norge, as a bachelorproject. The goad for this applicaiton is a system for handling the incoming data, store it, and make it accessible for other parts of the project.

It has been challenging working with alot of new software, and therefore posing as a very good learning experience.
